# fanoci_code
the Fano-CI code for the computation of decay widths of Fano resonances

Theory described in: [Miteva, T; Sisourat N. On the computation of decay widths of FANO resonances, Chem. Phys., 482, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301010416304785?via%3Dihub)


#### Changes, updates and more :)

----

2016

All signs of the matrix elements are corrected 
New input and excitation Fano-CI included

----

May 12, 2017

Partial decay widths implemented
Files fort.100x contain the partial widths for each 2h CI state !works!
